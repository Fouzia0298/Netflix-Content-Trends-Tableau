## 📖 Overview
This milestone represents the **final stage** of the Tableau Capstone Project.  
The goal was to transform the exploratory work and KPIs created in previous milestones into a **polished, audience-ready dashboard** that clearly tells the story of Netflix's content trends.

> *“Data visualization is not just about showing numbers – it's about delivering insights and driving decisions.”*

This final dashboard is designed for **executive stakeholders** to quickly understand Netflix’s content strategy, catalog growth, and audience focus.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Refine dashboard layout using **cognitive and visual design principles**.
2. Apply **visual hierarchy** and **pre-attentive attributes** to emphasize key takeaways.
3. Incorporate feedback from earlier milestones to improve usability and clarity.
4. Deliver a **single, interactive Tableau dashboard** that answers the project’s business question.

## 🧾 Design Choices

Here are three **specific design choices** made in the final dashboard and how they support the intended audience:

### **1. KPI Cards at the Top**
- **Reasoning:** Busy executives need quick, high-level insights.  
- **Implementation:** Placed the five main KPIs (Total Titles, % Movies, % TV Shows, Avg Duration for Movies, Avg Seasons for TV Shows) at the very top of the dashboard using large, bold fonts and clean spacing.  
- **Impact:** Allowed stakeholders to instantly understand Netflix's catalog performance without interacting further.

---

### **2. Color-Coding by Content Type**
- **Reasoning:** To visually differentiate **Movies vs TV Shows** without overwhelming the user.  
- **Implementation:** 
  - **Movies:** Red accents (aligned with Netflix branding).  
  - **TV Shows:** Blue accents for contrast.  
- **Impact:** Created immediate clarity and guided the user’s attention to trends between the two content types.

---

### **3. Simplified Layout with Visual Hierarchy**
- **Reasoning:** Prevent dashboard clutter and cognitive overload.  
- **Implementation:**
  - Top row: High-level KPIs.  
  - Middle section: Growth over time (line chart).  
  - Bottom section: Ratings distribution and content type comparison.  
- **Impact:** Clear narrative flow from **overview → trend analysis → detailed breakdown**.

## 📝 Reflection: Comparing Proposal vs Final Deliverable

| **Aspect**            | **Original Proposal**                                   | **Final Dashboard**                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**              | Analyze Netflix catalog trends globally.                 | Uncover growth patterns, audience focus, and content type mix. |
| **Audience**          | General Netflix users and content managers.              | Executive-level decision-makers and strategists.  |
| **Design**            | Focus on exploratory charts with minimal interactivity.  | Highly interactive with filters, parameters, and clean visual hierarchy. |
| **KPIs**              | None initially defined.                                  | 5 core KPIs created and highlighted at the top.   |

**Summary of Changes:**
- Initially, the project was exploratory, with no clear visual hierarchy.  
- Through peer feedback and iteration, the design evolved to **tell a story**, guiding the audience step-by-step from KPIs to detailed insights.
- Simplification was key — removing unnecessary charts improved clarity and impact.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
1. **Importance of Data Cleaning:**  
   - Even small errors like null values or incorrect data types can distort analysis.  
   - Early cleaning ensured reliable results and trustworthiness.

2. **Design Thinking Matters:**  
   - Visual hierarchy and color usage greatly affect how stakeholders perceive insights.  
   - Cognitive load must be minimized for executive dashboards.

3. **Iterative Process is Key:**  
   - Exploration in Milestone 3 was messy but essential.  
   - Many chart types were discarded before arriving at the final clean design.

4. **Storytelling Drives Engagement:**  
   - Data alone isn’t enough — structuring it into a compelling narrative helps stakeholders take action.
