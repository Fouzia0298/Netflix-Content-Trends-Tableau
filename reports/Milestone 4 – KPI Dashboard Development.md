# üìù Reflection

This milestone clarified the core metrics that matter most to the audience:
- Overall size of Netflix's catalog
- Content type mix (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Growth trend over time
- Audience segmentation by rating

Creating calculated fields directly in Tableau improved flexibility and eliminated the need for heavy preprocessing in external tools.

Peer feedback also highlighted the importance of keeping KPIs at the very top of the dashboard so viewers can quickly understand the big picture before exploring detailed visualizations.
